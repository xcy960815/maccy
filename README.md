   You can also enable "double-click to open" in Preferences -> General and choose <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd>, <kbd>SHIFT (⇧)</kbd>, or <kbd>CONTROL (⌃)</kbd> as the trigger. When enabled, the regular popup shortcut is temporarily disabled and restored automatically when you turn the option off.
2. Type what you want to find.
3. To select the history item you wish to copy, press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, or click the item, or use <kbd>COMMAND (⌘)</kbd> + `n` shortcut.
4. To choose the history item and paste, press <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, or <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>CLICK</kbd> the item, or use <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + `n` shortcut.
5. To choose the history item and paste without formatting, press <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT (⇧)</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd>, or <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT (⇧)</kbd> + <kbd>CLICK</kbd> the item, or use <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT (⇧)</kbd> + `n` shortcut.
6. To delete the history item, press <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>DELETE (⌫)</kbd>.
7. To see the full text of the history item, wait a couple of seconds for tooltip.

9. To clear all unpinned items, select _Clear_ in the menu, or press <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>COMMAND (⌘)</kbd> + <kbd>DELETE (⌫)</kbd>. To clear all items including pinned, select _Clear_ in the menu with  <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> pressed, or press <kbd>SHIFT (⇧)</kbd> + <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>COMMAND (⌘)</kbd> + <kbd>DELETE (⌫)</kbd>.
10. To disable Clipbook and ignore new copies, click on the menu icon with <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> pressed.
11. To ignore only the next copy, click on the menu icon with <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT (⇧)</kbd> pressed.

## Advanced

### Ignore Copied Items

You can tell Clipbook to ignore all copied items:

```sh
defaults write com.xcy960815.Clipbook ignoreEvents true # default is false
```

This is useful if you have some workflow for copying sensitive data. You can set `ignoreEvents` to true, copy the data and set `ignoreEvents` back to false.

You can also click the menu icon with <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> pressed. To ignore only the next copy, click with <kbd>OPTION (⌥)</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT (⇧)</kbd> pressed.

### Ignore Custom Copy Types

By default Clipbook will ignore certain copy types that are considered to be confidential
or temporary. The default list always include the following types:

* `org.nspasteboard.TransientType`
* `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`
* `org.nspasteboard.AutoGeneratedType`

Also, default configuration includes the following types but they can be removed
or overwritten:

* `com.agilebits.onepassword`
* `com.typeit4me.clipping`
* `de.petermaurer.TransientPasteboardType`
* `Pasteboard generator type`
* `net.antelle.keeweb`

You can add additional custom types using settings.
To find what custom types are used by an application, you can use
free application [Pasteboard-Viewer](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Pasteboard-Viewer).
Simply download the application, open it, copy something from the application you
want to ignore and look for any custom types in the left sidebar. You can also browse
related discussions in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/xcy960815/Clipbook/issues).

### Speed up Clipboard Check Interval

By default, Clipbook checks clipboard every 500 ms, which should be enough for most users. If you want
to speed it up, you can change it with `defaults`:

```sh
defaults write com.xcy960815.Clipbook clipboardCheckInterval 0.1 # 100 ms
```

## FAQ

### Why doesn't it paste when I select an item in history?

1. Make sure you have "Paste automatically" enabled in Preferences.
2. Make sure "Clipbook" is added to System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility.

### When assigning a hotkey to open Clipbook, it says that this hotkey is already used in some system setting.

1. Open System settings -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts.
2. Find where that hotkey is used. For example, "Convert text to simplified Chinese" is under Services -> Text.
3. Disable that hotkey or remove the assigned combination in the corresponding system shortcut entry.
4. Restart Clipbook.
5. Assign hotkey in Clipbook settings.

### How to restore hidden footer?

1. Open Clipbook window.
2. Press <kbd>COMMAND (⌘)</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd> to open preferences.
3. Enable footer in Appearance section.

If for some reason it doesn't work, run the following command in Terminal.app:

```sh
defaults write com.xcy960815.Clipbook showFooter 1
```

### How to ignore copies from [Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102430)?

1. Open Preferences -> Ignore -> Pasteboard Types.
2. Add `com.apple.is-remote-clipboard`.

### My keyboard shortcut stopped working in password fields. How do I fix this?

If your shortcut produces a character (like `Option+C` → "ç"), macOS security may block it in password fields. Use [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) to remap your shortcut to a different combination like `Cmd+Shift+C`. [See detailed solution](docs/keyboard-shortcut-password-fields.md).

## Motivation

There are dozens of similar applications out there, so why build another?
Over the past years since I moved from Linux to macOS, I struggled to find
a clipboard manager that is as free and simple as [Parcellite](http://parcellite.sourceforge.net),
but I couldn't. So I've decided to build one.

Also, I wanted to learn Swift and get acquainted with macOS application development.
